## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript



### What I learned
I have learn how to make a responsive web page that meet both desktop amd mobile view with different image for each view. I also learn how to toggle the menu with Javascript.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
.menu-toggle {
display: block;
}
```
```js
 document.querySelector('.hub').classList.toggle('active');
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I will like to continued and go dive deeper into javascript.


### Useful resources

- [W3School](https://www.W3School.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Dave Gray CSS tutorial](https://youtu.be/n4R2E7O-Ngo?si=WptS2iJM7tPhzyNm) - This is an amazing tutorial video which helped me finally understand dropdown menu and responsive (@media query). I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
